                            Coming from a tech family environment, I was always interested in computers and coding. As a
                            <b>US Citizen</b>, I decided to take the opportunity and start working here. As of June
                            2023, I am based in San Diego County, and actively looking for an <b>internship</b>
                            (anywhere in the US really).

                            My favorite subjects at school were Maths and Physics. After completing high school in
                            France, I wasn't sure what wanted to do, so I decided to pursue studies in <b>Science</b>
                            for a 2 year degree. I then realized that I wanted to become a software developer which led
                            me to ENSIM, to prepare a Master's Degree in <b>Computer Science</b>.

                            My favorite hobbies include <b>traveling</b> and taking <b>pictures</b> (mostly
                            <b>timelapses</b>) everywhere I go. And what better experience than to arrive in the US
                            doing a 2 months solo road trip through Mexico and the United States!
