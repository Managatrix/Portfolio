        "Description": "<p>A complete and secure <strong>event management solution</strong> for hosts and guests using <strong>Flutter</strong>. The solution works both online and offline, thanks to its reliance on a <strong>Firebase </strong>database, <strong>cached data</strong>, and <strong>Bluetooth </strong>communication between devices. As a team of three students, we used <strong>Git </strong>for collaboration and software engineering methods such as <strong>use case scenarios</strong> and <strong>Figma mockups</strong>.</p><p><strong>Event creation:&nbsp;</strong>Hosts can create events with a variety of details. They&nbsp;generate and send unique <strong>QR codes</strong> for each guest.</p><p><strong>Guest management:</strong>&nbsp;When guests arrive at the event, they can show their QR code to the <strong>host or a volunteer&nbsp;</strong>for entry.</p><p><strong>Offline support:</strong>&nbsp;The app works even when there is no internet connection. In this case, it relies on<strong> cached data</strong> and <strong>Bluetooth </strong>communication to keep the <strong>local databases synchronized</strong>.</p><p><strong>Event security:</strong>&nbsp;The local databases are synchronized, and&nbsp;every entry and exit is monitored. This ensures that no ticket can be used multiple times.</p>",
